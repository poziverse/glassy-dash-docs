### Good Help Request Example
```
Title: Error when importing Google Takeout JSON

I'm trying to import notes from Google Keep but getting this error:

Error: Failed to parse JSON at line 45

I've tried:
1. Verified JSON is valid (jsonlint.com)
2. Updated to latest version (v0.67)
3. Cleared browser cache

Here's the JSON file:
```json
{
  "title": "My Note",
  "content": "..."
}
```

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
```
